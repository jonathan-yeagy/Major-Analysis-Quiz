## Getting Started

**Entrypoint:** index.html

> **Note:** This project requires access to a database and CSS files that are property of Pennsylvania College of Technology.

## Context

This project was made as my capstone project in 2020 in collaboration with the Pennsylvania College of Technology's
Public Relations and Marketing Department.

The idea was to have a "Tinder"-style design layout where users swiped cards left, right, or up in order to answer
questions. Each question would be weighted on how a typical student in the corresponding major would answer that
question and how important that question was to that specific major.

During this process, a spider graph would display information about how closely each major aligned with the user's
responses. Upon completion, the top 3 majors were displayed to the user with a prompt to have them emailed to the user.

I developed this project over the course of the semester.

> **Note:** This project was never launched due to an inability to effectively gather data from students during the COVID-19 crisis. Had this project proceeded as planned, it would have been integrated into the college's Drupal website.
